## If you are looking for some ideal cigarette smoker gifts, this list should be able to give you some hint.

#### 1. Skincare Kit
Smoking can speed up the normal aging process of your skin, contributing to wrinkles. The nicotine in cigarettes causes narrowing of the blood vessels in the outermost layers of your skin. This impairs blood flow to your skin. With less blood flow, skin doesn't get as much oxygen and important nutrients, such as vitamin A.

Moisturizer with Niacinimide, peptides and glycerin would be a good choice. These ingredients can help speed skin surface cell turnover, improving damaged skin and replenishing lost moisture. Essence with antioxidants, such as Carnosine or vitamin E, will help protect the skin surface from free radical damage.

#### 2. E-cigarette 
In August 2018, Public Health England published an evidence review concludes that e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful to health than tobacco and have the potential to help smokers quit smoking.

If you are looking for an entry-level vape for your beloved one, keep in mind to choose those with new [vaping technology](http://www.feelmtech.com/). The recent Golden Leaf Award winning technology uses a special ceramic cube with an integrated flat metal film to replace traditional coil. The metal film design creates an extraordinary broad heating surface that can intelligently apply the controlled temperature, ensures instant vapor production and true flavor. The [FEELM](http://www.feelmtech.com/) 0.1mm diameter cellular pinhole of the ceramic coil can heat and vaporize the E-liquid consistently and sufficiently, from the first to the last puff. In addition, the plug-and-play design makes an easy transition from tobacco to e-cigarette.

#### 3. Stain-remove Toothcare
Everyone want their smile to be nice and white. However, cigarette smoke has ingredients with a high propensity for staining teeth. The only foolproof method to prevent those stains from ruining your smile is to abstain from smoking and drinking coffee entirely. For those who cannot quit smoking right away, teeth whitening toothpaste with special formulate or teeth whitening treatment sets are available on the market that can help smokers get rid of the plague and turn our teeth white again. A mouth spray also helps eliminate tobacco breath.

#### 4. Gym Membership

Gifting a gym membership or personal training certificate can certainly be tricky. You don’t want to offend anyone or hurt their feelings. It’s a great, generous gift, rooted in love. Giving a loved one a gym contract can promote quality time together. Remember to focus on the positive effects of exercise when give it away.
